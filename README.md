#File Word Count

This program will take a filename and prints the words and count of their occurences in descending order.

For example:

		word_count("article.txt")

		"the", 268
		"and", 143
		"to", 133
    ...




*** Modification - word_count 2.0 will allow you get specified number of n most common words. i.e. instead of seeing all words, you can query for only for example, the 5 most common words.
